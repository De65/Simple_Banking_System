# Banking System Project

Welcome to the Banking System project! This project aims to create a fully functional banking system where users can create accounts, make deposits, withdraw funds, and check their balances. This is a hands-on project to test and improve my understanding of Java programming.

## Features

- **Account Management:** Create and manage user accounts.
- **Transactions:** Make deposits and withdrawals.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Check the balance of an account.

## Technical Overview

### Language Used

- **Java:** The project is developed using Java, leveraging its object-oriented features for a robust and scalable design.

### Concepts Applied

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The project makes use of classes and objects to represent accounts and transactions.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data to protect account details and ensure data integrity.
- **Inheritance:** Applying inheritance for code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizing arrays and lists to manage and store account information and transactions.

## Classes and Methods

### Accounts

- **Account Details:** Store and manage information such as account holder's name, ID, phone number, and account number.
- **Getters and Setters:** Ensure encapsulation by providing methods to access and update account information.

### Transactions

- **Deposit:** Method to add funds to an account.
- **Withdraw:** Method to subtract funds from an account.
- **Check Balance:** Method to display the current balance of an account.

## Why This Project?

This project serves as a practical application of the Java concepts I've learned. By building this banking system, I aim to solidify my understanding of Java programming, particularly in OOP, and see how effectively I can apply these concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Wish Me Luck!

I'm excited to embark on this journey and see how far I can push my Java skills. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
