Creating a banking system where the user is able to create an account, make deposits, make withdrawals, and check their balances.

Language used:
We will use java, where we will be using classes, where the classes will be for accounts and transactions.
We will use Encapsulation, and a little bit of inheritance.
Objects, methods, arrays,and lists.

I just want to see how far I have been able to grasp java. Wish me luck!!
